## Result

Successfully implemented a **Cross-Region EC2 Backup and Disaster Recovery architecture** using **Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, AWS Backup, AWS KMS, IAM, Amazon VPC, and AWS Security Groups**.

Created a disposable Mumbai workload with an encrypted EBS root volume, protected the EC2 instance using AWS Backup, created a dedicated source backup vault, copied the completed recovery point to a dedicated backup vault in **N. Virginia (`us-east-1`)**, and restored the workload as a new EC2 instance.

Validated the recovered application using **HTTP 200**, `/health`, IMDSv2 metadata, the synthetic `DAY16` recovery marker, the restored instance ID, Region metadata, EBS encryption, and application readiness.

Verified that the source and restored EC2 instances had different instance IDs and that the recovered workload successfully operated in **N. Virginia (`us-east-1`)**.

## Part A – Record the Recovery Design

**Chosen workload RTO:** 30 minutes

**Chosen workload RPO:** 4 hours

**DR strategy:** Backup and Restore

### Reason this strategy fits

Backup and Restore is a suitable DR strategy for this workload because it is simple, cost-effective, and sufficient when some downtime and data loss are acceptable. The workload can be restored as a small EC2 instance (`t3.micro`) from an AWS Backup recovery point in the N. Virginia recovery Region.

**Target-Region quotas checked:** Yes

### Dependencies required after restore

- `t3.micro` EC2 instance
- Encrypted EBS volume
- Target VPC and subnet
- Route table and Internet Gateway
- Security group
- KMS key
- IAM permissions/role
- Nginx service
- Systemd render service
- Approved administration/management method

### Why a completed backup alone does not prove the RTO

A completed backup only proves that a recovery point was successfully created. It does not prove how quickly the workload can be restored and made operational.

The RTO also includes recovery declaration, orchestration, restore, configuration, dependency setup, application startup, validation, and traffic cutover where applicable.

Therefore, the RTO must be demonstrated through an actual recovery and validation test.

sudo systemctl stop nginx
curl --max-time 5 http://localhost/health || true
```

- Confirmed that the application was no longer serving the health endpoint.
- Recorded the incident and recovery-declaration timestamps in UTC.

```text
Incident Time:             2026-08-29T15:17:15Z
Detection Time:            2026-08-29T15:17:48Z
Recovery Declaration Time: 2026-08-29T15:18:01Z
```

# Part C – Recovery Validation

## 22. Source and Restored Instance Comparison

- Compared the source Mumbai EC2 instance with the restored N. Virginia EC2 instance.
- Confirmed that the two workloads have different EC2 instance IDs.
- Verified that the recovered workload was created as a new EC2 resource.

| Attribute | Primary | Restored |
|---|---|---|
| Region | Mumbai (`ap-south-1`) | N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) |
| Instance | `srdangat-day16-primary` | `srdangat-day16-dr-restored` |
| Instance ID | `i-0b551363076304539` | `i-03f64b1ca2f3ea153` |
| Application | Nginx | Nginx |
| EBS | Encrypted | Encrypted |
| Recovery | Original | AWS Backup Restore |

## 23. Calculate Achieved RTO

The **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** is the maximum acceptable time within which the workload should be recovered after an incident.


### RTO Calculation Method

For this lab, the **Achieved RTO** is the measured duration from the simulated incident until the recovered application successfully passes validation.

```text
Achieved RTO = Detection
             + Recovery Declaration
             + Orchestration
             + Restore
             + Configuration
             + Validation
```

Each recovery phase duration is calculated from the recorded UTC timestamps for the corresponding recovery milestones.

---

### Recorded Timestamps

All RTO calculations are performed using **UTC** to avoid time-zone confusion.

```text
INCIDENT_UTC:               2026-08-29T15:17:15Z

### RTO Phase Calculation

| Recovery Phase         | Calculation           |   Duration |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------: |
| Detection              | `15:17:48 - 15:17:15` | `00:00:33` |
| Recovery Declaration   | `15:18:01 - 15:17:48` | `00:00:13` |
| Orchestration          | `15:24:57 - 15:18:01` | `00:06:56` |
| Restore                | `15:26:14 - 15:24:57` | `00:01:17` |
| Configuration          | `15:38:53 - 15:26:14` | `00:12:39` |
| Application Validation | `15:39:02 - 15:38:53` | `00:00:09` |

### Phase-by-Phase Explanation

**1. Detection**

The simulated incident occurred at `15:17:15` and the failure was detected at `15:17:48`.

```text
15:17:48 - 15:17:15 = 00:00:33
```

**Detection duration = 33 seconds**

---

**2. Recovery Declaration**

The failure was detected at `15:17:48` and the recovery was formally declared at `15:18:01`.

```text
15:18:01 - 15:17:48 = 00:00:13
```

**Recovery declaration duration = 13 seconds**

---

**3. Orchestration**

Recovery was declared at `15:18:01` and the restore orchestration started at `15:24:57`.

```text
15:24:57 - 15:18:01 = 00:06:56
```

**Orchestration duration = 6 minutes 56 seconds**

---

**4. Restore**

The restore orchestration started at `15:24:57` and the AWS Backup restore completed at `15:26:14`.

```text
15:26:14 - 15:24:57 = 00:01:17
```

**Restore duration = 1 minute 17 seconds**

---

**5. Configuration**

The restore completed at `15:26:14` and the recovered environment finished configuration at `15:38:53`.

```text
15:38:53 - 15:26:14 = 00:12:39
```

**Configuration duration = 12 minutes 39 seconds**

---

**6. Application Validation**

Configuration completed at `15:38:53` and the recovered application passed validation at `15:39:02`.

```text
15:39:02 - 15:38:53 = 00:00:09
```

**Application validation duration = 9 seconds**

---

### Total RTO Calculation

```text
Detection                00:00:33
Recovery Declaration     00:00:13
Orchestration            00:06:56
Restore                  00:01:17
Configuration            00:12:39
Application Validation   00:00:09
                         ----------
Total                    00:21:47
```

Therefore:

```text
Achieved RTO = 21 minutes 47 seconds
```

**Measured RTO: 21 minutes 47 seconds**

The measured RTO is the result of this specific recovery test and is not a guaranteed SLA for future recoveries.

---

## 24. RPO Calculation

The **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.

For this DR test, the achieved RPO is calculated using the time difference between the simulated incident and the **latest usable copied recovery point available in the destination Region**.

```text
Achieved RPO = Incident time - Latest usable copied recovery-point time
```

### Recorded Timestamps

All RPO calculations are performed using **UTC** to avoid time-zone confusion.

```text
Incident Time:
2026-08-29T15:17:15Z

Latest Usable Copied Recovery-Point Time:
2026-08-29T15:01:47Z
```

### RPO Calculation

```text
15:17:15 UTC
-15:01:47 UTC
----------------
00:15:28
```

**Measured RPO for this specific DR test: 15 minutes 28 seconds**

---

### RPO Measurement Note

- The **15 minutes 28 seconds** represents the measured recovery-point gap for this specific DR test.

- The timestamp used for the calculation is **15:01:47 UTC**, which is the recorded **latest usable copied recovery-point time** in the destination N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) Backup vault.

- The destination recovery point displayed a creation time of **20:00:37 IST**. This timestamp is not used in the RPO calculation because the RPO is measured using the **latest usable copied recovery-point time**, which was recorded as **15:01:47 UTC**.

- The cross-Region copy completion time was **15:01:47 UTC (20:31:47 IST)**, while the simulated incident occurred at **15:17:15 UTC (20:47:15 IST)**. These represent the same moments expressed in different time zones.

- This measured RPO is **not a guaranteed ongoing RPO** because the recovery point was created and copied on demand rather than through a continuously running backup schedule.

---

## RTO/RPO Objective Result

| Objective |     Target |              Achieved |  Result  |
| --------- | ---------: | --------------------: | :------: |
| RTO       | 30 minutes | 21 minutes 47 seconds | **PASS** |
| RPO       |    4 hours | 15 minutes 28 seconds | **PASS** |

---

## Important RTO/RPO Measurement Note

**Detection is not recovery.**

A completed restore is not application validation.

Application validation is not traffic cutover.

Each milestone was recorded separately so that the measured RTO represents the **complete recovery workflow used in this lab**.

The achieved RTO of **21 minutes 47 seconds** is the result of this specific recovery test. It is **not a guaranteed SLA** for all future recoveries.

The achieved RPO of **15 minutes 28 seconds** is the measured data-loss window for this specific DR test. It is **not a guaranteed ongoing RPO** because the recovery point was created and copied on demand rather than through a continuously running backup schedule.

# Part D – DR Design Decisions

## 25. DR Strategy Decision

Selected:

```text
DR Strategy: Backup and Restore
```

### Reason

- Appropriate for a disposable workload where cost optimization is important.
- The secondary environment does not need to remain continuously running.
- AWS Backup provides encrypted recovery points that can be copied across Regions.
- The target EC2 environment is created only when recovery is required.

### Trade-off

- Recovery takes longer than Pilot Light, Warm Standby, or Active-Active because infrastructure and application readiness must be restored and validated during the recovery event.

---

## 26. Hybrid Connectivity Decision Notes

Documented the following connectivity decisions without creating billable connectivity resources.

| Scenario | Decision |
|---|---|
| Rapid encrypted hybrid connection | Site-to-Site VPN |
| Predictable high bandwidth | Direct Connect |
| Many VPC and VPN attachments | Transit Gateway |
| On-premises resolves AWS private names | Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint |
| VPC forwards domains to on-premises DNS | Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint |
| Private S3 access | Gateway endpoint |
| Private AWS API access | Interface endpoint / PrivateLink |

- Site-to-Site VPN was selected when rapid encrypted connectivity is required.
- Direct Connect was identified for predictable private high-bandwidth connectivity.
- Transit Gateway was identified for centralized connectivity across many VPCs and VPN/DX attachments.
- Route 53 Resolver inbound/outbound endpoints were documented for hybrid DNS flows.
- Gateway endpoints were identified as the preferred private-routing option for supported services such as S3.

---

## 27. DR Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| Backup and Restore | Lowest-cost relaxed DR; infrastructure restored during recovery |
| Pilot Light | Core services remain running while the rest is recovered |
| Warm Standby | Reduced but operational environment is continuously available |
| Active-Active | Both Regions continuously serve production traffic |

For this lab, **Backup and Restore** was selected because the workload is disposable and the objective is to demonstrate encrypted cross-Region recovery without maintaining an always-on secondary environment.

---

## 28. Service Quota Readiness

Recorded a sanitized readiness assessment for both Regions.
