## Network Architecture

**Network Design Note:** For this implementation, a dedicated custom VPC was used to provide explicit separation between public, private application, and private database tiers across two Availability Zones.

The custom VPC uses three logical subnet tiers across two Availability Zones:

| Tier | AZ A | AZ B |
|---|---|---|
| Public | `10.0.0.0/20` | `10.0.16.0/20` |
| Private Application | `10.0.32.0/20` | `10.0.48.0/20` |
| Private Database | `10.0.64.0/20` | `10.0.80.0/20` |

### Route Table Design

**Public Route Table**

`cloudadhar-day13-public-rt`

- Public Subnet A
- Public Subnet B
- Local VPC route
- `0.0.0.0/0` → Internet Gateway

**Private Application Route Table**

`cloudadhar-day13-private-app-rt`

- Private Application Subnet A
- Private Application Subnet B
- Local VPC route
- `0.0.0.0/0` → NAT Gateway

**Private Database Route Table**

`cloudadhar-day13-private-db-rt`

- Private Database Subnet A
- Private Database Subnet B
- Local VPC route
- No default internet route

## Screenshots

### 1. EC2 Database Client

Created the private EC2 database client in Private Application Subnet A. The instance uses the private application route table and NAT Gateway for required outbound connectivity, while database traffic to RDS/Aurora is permitted through Security Group rules.

![01_EC2_Database_Client](screenshots/01_EC2_Database_Client.png)

---

### 2. RDS MySQL Database

Created the private RDS MySQL source database with encryption enabled, automated backups with 1-day retention, and public access disabled.

![02_RDS_MySQL_Database](screenshots/02_RDS_MySQL_Database.png)

---

### 3. RDS Security Group

Configured the RDS Security Group to allow MySQL TCP `3306` only from the approved client Security Group.

![03_RDS_Security_Group](screenshots/03_RDS_Security_Group.png)

---

### 4. RDS Database Connectivity

Connected to the private RDS MySQL database through the EC2 client using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Verified the cloudadhardb database and successfully executed a query returning 3 rows.

![04_RDS_Database_Connectivity](screenshots/04_RDS_Database_Connectivity.png)

---

### 5. Manual RDS Snapshot

Created and verified a manual snapshot of the RDS MySQL database.

![05_RDS_Manual_Snapshot](screenshots/05_RDS_Manual_Snapshot.png)

---

### 6. Restore Database from Manual Snapshot

Restored the RDS MySQL database from the manual snapshot `cloudadhar-rds-day13-snapshot` as a new DB instance named `cloudadhar-rds-day13-restored`. The original database remained unchanged.

After the restored database became **Available**, connected to it and verified that the database and `orders` table were successfully restored.

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, ENGINE
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'cloudadhardb';

SELECT * FROM cloudadhardb.orders;
```

![06b_RDS_Manual_Snapshot_Query](screenshots/06b_RDS_Manual_Snapshot_Query.png)

---

### 7. Point-in-Time Recovery

Restored the RDS database using Point-in-Time Recovery to a time between marker creation and deletion. Verified that the restored database contained the marker record and that the original source database remained unchanged.

![07_RDS_PITR_Source_Verification](screenshots/07d_RDS_PITR_Source_Verification.png)

---

### 8. RDS Read Replica

Created the RDS MySQL Read Replica and verified its replication status.

> **Note:** Read Replica creation required disabling Secrets Manager-managed credentials, so master credentials were switched to Self managed.

![08_RDS_Read_Replica](screenshots/08_RDS_Read_Replica.png)

---

### 9. Read Replica Validation

Verified asynchronous replication by inserting a test row on the source database, confirming its replication to the Read Replica, validating read-only behavior, and confirming that write attempts on the replica were rejected.

![09c_Read_Replica_ReadOnly](screenshots/09c_Read_Replica_ReadOnly.png)

---

### 10. Aurora Serverless v2 Cluster

Created the Aurora MySQL-Compatible Serverless v2 cluster in the private database subnets.

![10_Aurora_Serverless_v2_Cluster](screenshots/10_Aurora_Serverless_v2_Cluster.png)

---

### 11. Aurora Writer and Reader

Verified the Aurora Serverless v2 writer and reader instances.

![11a_Aurora_Writer](screenshots/11a_Aurora_Writer.png)


![11b_Aurora_Reader](screenshots/11b_Aurora_Reader.png)

---

### 12. Aurora Writer and Reader Endpoint Validation

Connected from the private EC2 Aurora database client through the Aurora writer endpoint and verified successful write access. Reconnected from the private EC2 Aurora database client through the Aurora reader endpoint and verified read-only database access.

![12_Ec2_aurora_client](screenshots/12_ec2_aurora_client.png)

![12a_Aurora_Writer_Endpoint](screenshots/12a_Aurora_Writer_Endpoint.png)

![12b_Aurora_Reader_Endpoint](screenshots/12b_Aurora_Reader_Endpoint.png)

---

### 13. Aurora Pre-Failover Validation

Connected through the Aurora cluster/writer endpoint and recorded the current writer hostname and read-only status before failover. The writer returned `@@innodb_read_only=0`.

![13_Aurora_Pre_Failover_Validation](screenshots/13_Aurora_Pre_Failover_Validation.png)

---

### 14. Aurora Failover

Performed an Aurora failover on the cloudadhar-aurora-serverless-day13 cluster and verified that the writer role moved from the previous writer instance to the other Aurora instance.

![14_Perform_Failover](screenshots/14_Perform_Failover.png)

![14_Aurora_Failover](screenshots/14_Aurora_before_after_failover_role.png)

---

### 14. Aurora Post-Failover Validation

Reconnected through the same Aurora cluster endpoint and verified that the underlying writer instance changed from `172.30.0.108` to `172.30.2.170` `@@innodb_read_only=0`, existing data remained available, and a new write succeeded after failover.

![15_Aurora_Post_Failover_Validation](screenshots/15_Aurora_Post_Failover_Validation.png)

---

### 16. RDS Proxy

Created and configured an Amazon RDS Proxy for the Aurora database cluster to provide connection pooling and secure database connectivity. The proxy uses the Aurora master secret for password-based authentication, requires TLS, and is deployed across private subnets for high availability. The default endpoint provides read/write access, with a separate read-only endpoint configured for read-only database connections.

![16_RDS_Proxy](screenshots/16_RDS_Proxy.png)

---

### 17. RDS Proxy Target Health

Verified that the Aurora targets were successfully registered and available through RDS Proxy.

![17_RDS_Proxy_Target_Health](screenshots/17_RDS_Proxy_Target_Health.png)

---

### 18. RDS Proxy Read/Write Endpoint


> **Note:** For the RDS Proxy demonstration, a **new Aurora Serverless v2 cluster is being created**. The previously created Aurora cluster was used for the earlier lab steps. Sections 18 and 19 below use the **new Aurora cluster** for demonstrating the RDS Proxy read/write and read-only endpoints.


Connected to Aurora MySQL through the RDS Proxy read/write endpoint and verified that the connection was routed to a writable backend.

![18_RDS_Proxy_Read_Write](screenshots/18_RDS_Proxy_Read_Write.png)

#### RDS Proxy TLS Certificate Verification Issue

Root Cause
----------

The MariaDB 10.5 client failed TLS server-certificate verification when
using the AWS RDS global-bundle.pem CA bundle.

`The connection returned:`

```bash
`ERROR 2026 (HY000):
TLS/SSL error: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

`The RDS Proxy itself was healthy and TLS was functioning correctly.
Connections using TLS without certificate verification succeeded, and the
same Proxy successfully established TLS 1.3 connections.`

`Testing with /root/AmazonRootCA1.pem successfully passed certificate
verification, confirming that the issue was related to CA trust-chain
validation in the MariaDB client environment rather than RDS Proxy
connectivity`


Resolution
----------

Downloaded official Amazon Trust Services:

```bash
wget https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem \
  -O /root/AmazonRootCA1.pem
```
`Use /root/AmazonRootCA1.pem as the trusted CA for the MariaDB client:`

```bash
mysql \
  -h cloudadhar-aurora-proxy-day13.proxy-chsoog6c6918.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
  -P 3306 \
  -u admin \
  -p \
  --ssl \
  --ssl-ca=/root/AmazonRootCA1.pem \
  --ssl-verify-server-cert \
  cloudadhardb
```

TLS was successfully established and server certificate verification
completed successfully.

---

### 19. RDS Proxy Read-Only Endpoint

Reconnected through the RDS Proxy read-only endpoint and verified read-only behavior. Read operations succeeded, while the write operation **failed as expected** because the endpoint routes connections to a read-only Aurora backend.

![19_RDS_Proxy_Read_Only](screenshots/19_RDS_Proxy_Read_Only.png)

---

## 20. Automate a Logical Table Backup with Systems Manager

### 20.1 Create the Private Backup Bucket

Created a private S3 bucket to store logical backups of the `orders` table, with Block Public Access, versioning, and SSE-S3 encryption enabled.

![20_1_RDS_Table_Backup_S3_Bucket](screenshots/20_1_RDS_Table_Backup_S3_Bucket.png)

---

### 20.2 Create a Dedicated Backup User and Secret

Created a dedicated MySQL backup user with `SELECT` permission on the `orders` table and stored its credentials securely in AWS Secrets Manager.

![20_2_RDS_Backup_User_Secret](screenshots/20_2_RDS_Backup_User_Secret.png)

---

### 20.3 Add Least-Privilege Permissions to the EC2 Role

Added least-privilege permissions to the EC2 instance role to retrieve the backup secret and upload backup objects to the designated S3 prefix.

![20_3_EC2_Backup_IAM_Permissions](screenshots/20_3_EC2_Backup_IAM_Permissions.png)

---

### 20.4 Verify the Managed-Node Prerequisites

Verified the SSM-managed EC2 database client and required backup utilities, including the MariaDB client, `jq`, `gzip`, `AWS CLI`, and `RDS CA bundle`.

![20_4_SSM_Managed_Node_Prerequisites](screenshots/20_4_SSM_Managed_Node_Prerequisites.png)

---

### 20.5 Create the SSM Command Document

Created the SSM Command document to securely export the `orders` table over TLS, compress the dump, and upload it to S3.

![20_5_SSM_Table_Backup_Document](screenshots/20_5_SSM_Table_Backup_Document.png)

---

### 20.6 Test the Document Once with Run Command

Tested the SSM Command document manually and verified successful creation of a timestamped `.sql.gz` backup in S3.

![20_6_SSM_Run_Command_Test](screenshots/20_6_SSM_Run_Command_Test.png)

---

### 20.7 Create the State Manager Association Dispatch Role

Created a dedicated IAM dispatch role for State Manager to send the approved backup command to the EC2 database client.

![20_7_SSM_Association_Dispatch_Role](screenshots/20_7_SSM_Association_Dispatch_Role.png)

---

### 20.8 Create the Scheduled State Manager Association

Created a State Manager association to automatically back up the logical `orders` table `every 24 hours`. The association executed successfully, and the resulting encrypted, `non-empty .sql.gz` backup file was verified in the `S3 bucket.`

![20_8_State_Manager_Scheduled_Association](screenshots/20_8_State_Manager_Scheduled_Orders_Table_Backup_Validation.png)

---

### 20.9 Validate the Scheduled Backup

Validated the `orders` table backup by downloading the `timestamped` `.sql.gz object` from `S3` to `EC2`, confirming successful transfer, and verifying the backup with `gzip -t` and SQL output inspection.

![20_9_Orders_Table_Backup_Gzip_Validation](screenshots/20_9_Orders_Table_Backup_Gzip_Validation.png)

---

# 22.10 Restore and Validate a Backup from S3

Downloaded a selected timestamped `.sql.gz` backup from S3 to the existing EC2 client, validated its gzip integrity, decompressed it locally, restored it into an isolated temporary MySQL database on the existing private RDS primary, verified the restored `orders` table and row counts, and removed the temporary test database and restore files.

---

## 1. Download the Backup from S3 to EC2, Validate and Decompress

Downloaded the selected backup from S3 to the EC2 client, validated its gzip integrity, and decompressed it locally

![22_10_Gzip_Validation_Decompression](screenshots/22_10_Gzip_Validation_Decompression.png)

---

## 2. Connect, Restore and Validate the Backup

Restored the S3 backup into a RDS database, verified the `orders table` and `row count`, and compared the restored data with the source database.

![22_10_Restore_And_Validate](screenshots/22_10_Restore_And_Validate.png)

---

## 3. Cleanup Temporary Database and Restore Files

After validation, remove the temporary RDS database and confirm it no longer exists.

![22_10_Cleanup_Complete](screenshots/22_10_Cleanup_Complete.png)

---

## Where I Got Stuck

I initially faced a TLS certificate verification error while connecting to the RDS Proxy using the MariaDB client and `global-bundle.pem`.

The Proxy was healthy and TLS connectivity was working, but certificate verification failed with:

```bash
ERROR 2026 (HY000): TLS/SSL error: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

After testing with the official `AmazonRootCA1.pem` certificate, the connection succeeded and the RDS Proxy certificate was verified successfully.

---
