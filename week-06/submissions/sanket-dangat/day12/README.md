## Result

Successfully completed and validated the Day 12 Amazon S3 lab covering private S3 buckets, Same-Region Replication (SRR), Cross-Region Replication (CRR), versioning, prefix-based replication, Transfer Acceleration, multipart upload cleanup, and AWS storage service reviews.

**Resources created:**

- Source Bucket `cloudadhar-day12-rep-source-<unique-suffix>` — Mumbai, `ap-south-1`
- SRR Destination Bucket `cloudadhar-day12-srr-dest-<unique-suffix>` — Mumbai, `ap-south-1`
- CRR Destination Bucket `cloudadhar-day12-crr-dest-<unique-suffix>` — Tokyo, `ap-northeast-1`
- Static Website Bucket `cloudadhar-day12-static-website-<unique-suffix>` — Mumbai, `ap-south-1`
- Object Lock Bucket `cloudadhar-day12-lock-sankted-<unique-suffix>` — Mumbai, `ap-south-1`
- SRR Rule `srr-prefix-rule`
- CRR Rule `crr-prefix-rule`
- Lifecycle Rule `abort-incomplete-multipart-uploads`

**Validation:** Verified that all three replication buckets remained private with ACLs disabled, Block Public Access enabled, Versioning enabled, and SSE-S3 encryption. Verified that objects uploaded after rule creation replicated according to the configured prefixes, while pre-rule and unmatched objects remained source-only. Verified SRR and CRR Version 1 and Version 2 replication, reviewed Transfer Acceleration, configured seven-day incomplete multipart-upload cleanup, and reviewed FSx and hybrid-storage options without deploying additional paid resources.

### 1. Three Private Versioned Buckets

Created the source, SRR destination, and CRR destination buckets with the standard S3 regional namespace, Bucket owner enforced / ACLs disabled, all four Block Public Access settings enabled, Versioning enabled, SSE-S3 default encryption, and Object Lock disabled.

---

### 2. Bucket Regions

Verified the source bucket in Mumbai (`ap-south-1`), SRR destination bucket in Mumbai (`ap-south-1`), and CRR destination bucket in Tokyo (`ap-northeast-1`).

### 3. Upload Objects Before Replication Rules

Created the `srr/` and `crr/` prefixes in the source bucket and uploaded:

- `srr/before-rule.txt`
- `crr/before-rule.txt`

Verified that both objects existed before the replication rules were created.

These objects were intentionally uploaded before the rules to demonstrate that live replication is not retroactive.

### 4. Same-Region Replication Rule

Created the SRR rule:

- Rule name `srr-prefix-rule`
- Status Enabled
- Prefix `srr/`
- Destination: Mumbai SRR bucket
- New IAM service role
- Existing-object replication disabled
- SSE-KMS/DSSE-KMS replication disabled
- Replication Time Control disabled
- Replication metrics disabled
- Delete-marker replication disabled
- Replica modification sync disabled

### 5. Cross-Region Replication Rule

Created the CRR rule:

- Rule name `crr-prefix-rule`
- Status Enabled
- Prefix `crr/`
- Destination: Tokyo CRR bucket
- New IAM service role
- Existing-object replication disabled
- SSE-KMS/DSSE-KMS replication disabled
- Replication Time Control disabled
- Replication metrics disabled
- Delete-marker replication disabled
- Replica modification sync disabled

### 6. SRR Version 1 Replication

Uploaded `cloudadhar-srr-demo.txt` to:

` srr/cloudadhar-srr-demo.txt `

Verified the source object's replication status progressed from `PENDING` to `COMPLETED`.

Confirmed that Version 1 appeared in the Mumbai SRR destination.

Also verified that the pre-rule object `srr/before-rule.txt` was absent from the destination.

---

### 7. CRR Version 1 Replication

Uploaded `cloudadhar-crr-demo.txt` to:

`crr/cloudadhar-crr-demo.txt`

Verified the source object's replication status progressed from `PENDING` to `COMPLETED`.

Confirmed that Version 1 appeared in the Tokyo CRR destination.

Also verified that the pre-rule object `crr/before-rule.txt` was absent from the destination.

---

### 8. SRR Version 2 Replication

Uploaded Version 2 using the same source key:

`srr/cloudadhar-srr-demo.txt`

Waited for replication to complete and enabled **Show versions**.

Verified that both Version 1 and Version 2 existed in:

- Source bucket
- Mumbai SRR destination

Verified that the pre-rule object remained source-only.

---

### 9. CRR Version 2 Replication

Uploaded Version 2 using the same source key:

`crr/cloudadhar-crr-demo.txt`

Waited for replication to complete and enabled **Show versions**.

Verified that both Version 1 and Version 2 existed in:

- Source bucket
- Tokyo CRR destination

Verified that the pre-rule object remained source-only.

---

### 10. Prefix Filtering Validation

Created the `other/` prefix and uploaded in the source bucket:

`other/no-replication-demo.txt`

Verified that the object did not match either replication rule.

Confirmed that:

- No replication status was shown for the unmatched object.
- The object remained in the source bucket.
- The object did not appear in either destination bucket.

### 11. Transfer Acceleration Review

Opened:

**Source Bucket → Properties → Transfer acceleration**

Verified that **Transfer Acceleration** was enabled for the source bucket.

Observed the accelerated endpoint generated in the format:

`<bucket-name>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`

Confirmed that the bucket name does not contain periods (`.`), which is a requirement for Transfer Acceleration compatibility.

This step was performed as a configuration review only. No performance benchmark or accelerated upload test was conducted, so the screenshot serves as evidence that the feature was successfully enabled.

### 12. Incomplete Multipart Upload Lifecycle Rule

Created the lifecycle rule:

`abort-incomplete-multipart-uploads`

Configuration:

- Scope: All objects
- Action: Delete incomplete multipart uploads
- Age: 7 days
- No object transitions
- No completed-object expiration
- No noncurrent-version deletion
- No expired delete-marker cleanup

Verified that the rule was active on the source bucket.

## 13. Object Lock Compliance

Created a dedicated Object Lock bucket in Mumbai with:

- Bucket owner enforced
- ACLs disabled
- Block Public Access enabled
- Versioning enabled
- SSE-S3 encryption
- Object Lock enabled
- No long default retention period

Uploaded `retention-demo.txt`, recorded its Version ID, and applied a short instructor-approved Compliance retention period.

![Object Lock Compliance](./screenshots/15-object-lock-compliance.png)

![Compliance Delete Denied](./screenshots/16-compliance-delete-denied.png)

Verified that permanent deletion of the protected data version returned `AccessDenied`.

A normal delete without selecting a Version ID may still create a delete marker; the protected data version remains retained until the Compliance period expires.

---

## 14. Native S3 Static Website

Created a separate disposable website bucket and temporarily configured native S3 static website hosting.

Uploaded:

- `index.html`
- `error.html`

Verified:

- Native HTTP website endpoint rendered `index.html`.
- Missing pages returned the configured custom error page.
- Only public `s3:GetObject` access was temporarily allowed.
- The public policy was removed immediately after evidence.
- All Block Public Access controls were restored.
- Website hosting was disabled after the demonstration.

### 15. Review the FSx Family

Reviewed the Amazon FSx filesystem options without creating a filesystem.

- Windows File Server — SMB, Windows, Active Directory
- Lustre — HPC, ML, parallel processing
- NetApp ONTAP — Enterprise NAS and NetApp compatibility
- OpenZFS — Managed ZFS for Linux workloads

---

### 16. Hybrid Storage Decisions

Reviewed AWS hybrid storage services based on their use cases without deploying paid resources.

- S3 File Gateway — Cached NFS/SMB access to S3
- Volume Gateway — Cloud-backed iSCSI volumes
- Tape Gateway — Virtual backup tapes
- DataSync — Automated online data movement
- Snow Family — Offline migration or edge compute
- Transfer Family — Managed SFTP/FTPS/FTP/AS2 into S3/EFS

No hybrid storage resources were deployed.
