# Result

- Completed all hands-on labs for serverless order processing and infrastructure-as-code using AWS Lambda, SQS, API Gateway, Step Functions, and CloudFormation
- Built a Lambda function (`cloudadhar-order-handler-day18`) and validated accepted, rejected, and technical-failure invocation paths
- Configured asynchronous Lambda retries (1 retry attempt) with an SQS failure destination (`cloudadhar-lambda-failure-day18`) and confirmed the failed event landed in the queue
- Created an HTTP API (`cloudadhar-orders-http-api-day18`) with a `POST /orders` route and verified HTTP 200 (accepted) and HTTP 400 (rejected) responses
- Built a Standard Step Functions workflow (`cloudadhar-order-workflow-day18`) with Retry/Catch/Choice/Succeed/Fail states and verified all three executions: Succeeded (accepted), Failed at OrderRejected (business rejection), and Failed at TechnicalFailure (Lambda failed after retries exhausted)
- Deployed the CloudAdhar infrastructure as a CloudFormation stack (`cloudadhar-infrastructure-day18`), reviewed stack events, and confirmed successful resource creation and update activity
- Created a Change Set to modify the SQS `VisibilityTimeout` (30 → 60 seconds) and executed it, confirming the queue was updated in place with no resource replacement
- Manually changed the queue's message retention period (4 Days → 1 Day) outside CloudFormation to create drift, ran drift detection, and confirmed it was flagged `MODIFIED`
- Reconciled the drifted property back to the template-defined value and confirmed the resource returned to `IN_SYNC`
- Reviewed the parameters and security requirements of the end-to-end order application template, then deployed it (EC2-hosted UI, HTTP API, 5 Lambda functions, a CloudFormation-managed Step Functions workflow, and DynamoDB — 22 resources total) and confirmed the Order Portal UI loaded successfully
- Submitted an accepted order (`O-UI-1801`, amount 4500) through the UI and verified it completed successfully end-to-end, with `status: COMPLETED` in DynamoDB and a Succeeded Step Functions execution
- Submitted a business-rejected order (`O-UI-1802`, amount 0) and verified it was rejected by business validation, with `status: REJECTED` in DynamoDB and a Failed execution at the `OrderRejected` state
- Submitted a technical-failure order (`O-UI-1803`, amount 500, simulated failure) and verified the workflow retried and then failed as expected, with `status: FAILED` in DynamoDB and a Failed execution at the `TechnicalFailure` state (via the `MarkTechnicalFailure` catch path)
- Deleted the end-to-end stack and confirmed the retained S3 archive bucket (`cloudadhar-archive-dev-day18-<account-id>`) survived deletion due to `DeletionPolicy: Retain` and `UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain`

## Where I Got Stuck

`No blocker`

---

## Cleanup
**Day 18 cleanup should be performed only after all required evidence has been captured.**

1. Delete the Lambda function `cloudadhar-order-handler-day18`.
2. Delete the created SQS failure-destination queue `cloudadhar-lambda-failure-day18`.
3. Delete the created HTTP API `cloudadhar-orders-http-api-day18`.
4. Delete the created Standard Step Functions workflow `cloudadhar-order-workflow-day18`.
5. Delete the CloudFormation stack `cloudadhar-infrastructure-day18`.
6. Verify the retained S3 archive bucket `cloudadhar-archive-dev-day18-<ACCOUNT-ID>` survived stack deletion, then empty and delete it manually, since `DeletionPolicy`/`UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain` does not delete it automatically.
7. Verify that no billable Day 18 resources remain in Mumbai (`ap-south-1`).
